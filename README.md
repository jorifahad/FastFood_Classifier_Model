# **AI-Powered Food Classifier** 🍕🍔🌯

## **Overview**
This project features an AI-powered food classification model designed to recognize three popular fast-food categories:

- 🍕 Pizza
- 🍔 Burger
- 🌯 Shawarma

By leveraging machine learning, the model can analyze food images and accurately identify the type of food, offering a modern solution for food recognition tasks.

## **🛠️ How It Works**
1. **Model Training:** 
   - The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled images of pizza, burgers, and shawarma. 
   - Each category is labeled numerically: `0` for pizza, `1` for burger, and `2` for shawarma.
   - The training resulted in a model capable of identifying food types with high accuracy.

2. **Image Testing:**
   - Users can upload images of food to be classified.
   - The model processes the images and predicts the food category based on learned patterns.

3. **Results Display:**
   - The model outputs the predicted food type along with a confidence score, indicating the likelihood of the prediction.
