## **🛠️ How It Works**
1. **Model Training:** 
   - The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled images of pizza, burgers, and shawarma. 
   - Each category is labeled numerically: `0` for pizza, `1` for burger, and `2` for shawarma.
   - The training resulted in a model capable of identifying food types with high accuracy.

2. **Image Testing:**
   - Users can upload images of food to be classified.

3. **Results Display:**
   - The model outputs the predicted food type along with a confidence score.
